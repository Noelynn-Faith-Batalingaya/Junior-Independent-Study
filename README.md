# Shift-Left Accessibility for UX/UI: A Figma Preflight vs. Code-Time Checks (Pilot)
This project tests whether a quick design-time accessibility preflight in Figma can catch issues earlier than fixing them after the site is built. I will design two screens (Home + Register), run a 5-item preflight, then build the same screens in code and test with keyboard, VoiceOver, Lighthouse, and axe.
