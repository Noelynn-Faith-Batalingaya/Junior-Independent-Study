The authors develop methods to assess digital accessibility directly from mockups, bridging a common gap between design and implementation. The study is credible because it was presented at CHI, a top peer-reviewed HCI conference. For my project, this source is especially useful as it highlights how accessibility needs to be embedded at the earliest stages of UX/UI work rather than left as an afterthought.}

The authors highlight challenges such as lack of organizational support, limited time, and uneven training in accessibility. Despite these challenges, the study identifies opportunities for improving both industry practices and academic preparation. This is highly relevant to my research as it connects accessibility theory to real-world UX practice.}

Using automated tools and design heuristics, the study shows how many accessibility problems can already be identified before development begins. For my project, this demonstrates practical, design-centered methods for integrating accessibility into UX workflows.}
